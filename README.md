# unit02-portfolio
This project is a basic portfolio page

This is actually the second or third rendering of the page: I was determined to figure out how to successfully use grid and flexbox to position my elements (which I did!). Unfortunately, I deleted my first attempts from this repo, which I regret doing now. They would have better showed my progression, and I still could have linked the final successful page here without a problem. Oh well...live and learn.
